This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 # The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
	1. To add a car
	2. To view a list of cars
	3. To quit the program

*When a new car is entered, it is sorted into a list in the file my_old_cars by year:make:model*
